## React Introduction  

What is React?
React is a front-end JavaScript library.
React was developed by the Facebook Software Engineer Jordan Walke.
React is also known as React.js or ReactJS.
React is a tool for building UI components.

## How does React Work?
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed
React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
